Maximum number of roundtrips push list of data with Firebase Real Time Database





In my angular 4 application I use the push() method to append data to a list of data in Firebase real time database. See Firebase documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/lists-of-data

The push() method generates a unique key every time a new child is added to the specified Firebase reference. I have written the following code in Angular 4:


import {AngularFireDatabase} from 'angularfire2/database';
import * as firebase from 'firebase';

market = [
  { symbol: '1ST', price_usd: 1, balance: 100},
  { symbol: '2ND', price_usd: 2, balance: 300},
  { symbol: '3RD', price_usd: 3, balance: 400}
];

constructor(private db: AngularFireDatabase) {}

storeTicker() {
  const timestamp = firebase.database.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP;
  for (let object of market) {
    const path = object['symbol'];
    const itemsRef = this.db.list('Tickers/' + path);
    itemsRef.push({ symbol: path, price_usd: object['price_usd'], balance: object['balance'], time: timestamp});
  }
}

The code is executed when a button is clicked, this will result in a time-series for each reference.

My Firebase Real Time database looks like this:
{
  "Tickers" : {
    "1ST" : {
    "-Kx8gN5uZALd5BP2GCH6" : {
      "balance" : 0,
        "price_usd" : 0.25583,
        "symbol" : "1ST",
        "time" : 1508769890908
    }},
    "2ND" : {
      "-Kx8Z0xCl7ONZERk1ICo" : {
        "balance" : 0,
          "price_usd" : 0.0253829,
          "symbol" : "2ND",
          "time" : 1508767703084
    }},
    "3RD" : {
      "-Kx8gN5FEZEPsOe8S-Tw" : {
        "balance" : 0,
          "price_usd" : 0.767354,
          "symbol" : "3RD",
          "time" : 1508769890886
    }},
  // with a  total of 250 paths

  }}


Each call to push in this way will result in a roundtrip to Firebase. The problem is that Firebase only does push() for the first 100 references.


  I cannot find a maximum limit of number of roundtrips in the Firebase documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/limits

I foudn one qustion on Stackoverflow with similar problem but I don't understand the update

My question is:
1) Is there a maximum number of roundrtips in Firebase?
  2) Can I make my code more efficient by combining them into a multi-location update



  Can I combine the push roundtrips into a multi-location update with the code in this question:
